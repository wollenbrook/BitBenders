Loved
W - Brackets can finally display dynamically and properly
M - Loved how the front end has come out
MM - Happy that Identity is now working correctly with little to no error or bugs
Longed For
W - An easier way to find solutions to the bracket showing issues
M - the sms number to be approved and working
MM - For images to be easier to work with in azure and for azure to have better error codes
Loathed
W - How jquery ui gives you very little control on how users can manipulate the bracket
M - How sms the feature was perceived to be something that works based on previous presentations, but was changed to no longer work this last year and caused a huge hiccup to happen with the user story. 
MM - How useless and non existent error codes are in azure despite it working as intended locally, along with how tedious setting up testing can be. 
Learned 
W - Don’t try to squeeze user stories that are bigger than you anticipate into the current sprint, as this will create problems and bottle necks with work. 
M - Better understanding on having and creating a template for email allows the email to look far more professional. 
MM - How to identify issues with azure and local deployment separately, and how issues are solved if you just run the up and down script. 
Action 
Removed Loathed 
W - FInding a different solution or finding a way to manipulate what it gives you
M - Spend less time trying to find an alternative solution and ask around with peers and see what they have found. 
MM - Learn how azure reacts to certain changes and see the difference between local and deployment
Enhance Loved 
W - 
M - Continue to improve upon the current design and implement images as part of said design
MM - Continue to learn about Identity while not having to work on it so I can make my understanding even better without the stress of a feature tied to it.
