Loved
M - Loved the challenge because we had to finish certain tasks within a time limit
W - Loved how the feature of the project is looking
MM - Loved how incredibly useful the user identity aspects of the project are coming along
Longed For
M - Wish I had more time to implement a more professional looking announcement feature
W - Wish he had more options in terms of finding a way to have the user bracket be displayed. 
MM - Wish I had more time to implement my last feature, as I had not managed my time well
Loathed
M - A small bug caused a lot of time to be wasted as it was hard to pin down and caused a complete stop on the feature progress
W - FInding what seemed to be a solution for the feature but then spending 12+ hours just to learn that it was not a solution
MM - I hated user identity at first because of how convoluted it was, especially the razor pages scaffolding and how they do things differently to how we have learned this. 
Learned
M - Learned that for the first sprint time management was not the most efficient, and I learned how to manage my time for the better. Each task needs its own proper time allotted. 
W - Learned that no task is a given, every task is something that will have its difficulty and should be treated as so
MM - I learned that I need to account for things not working and taking allot of time to fix, therefore I should always allot a few extra hours for each feature in order for them to get done in a timely manner. 

Action 
Remove Loathed
M - We will have a discussion with the group and provide a fresh perspective on the bug instead of trying to solve it on our own individual merits for a long period of time. 
W - We will spend less time looking at a particular solution and cutting our losses before investing too much time into it. There is more than one solution to every problem. 
MM - We will learn different aspects of razor, and how they all come together to create the identity feature in order to be more efficient and understand the entire project. 
Amplify Loved
We will try to keep tasks challenging so that our project will continue to be prestigious while trying to keep it within the scope of our knowledge and tools. Our time allocation also needs to be more generous when it comes to features, even if they look simple to implement.
