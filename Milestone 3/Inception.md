Project Inception Worksheet
=====================================

## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development
    We intend on using the Agile methodology to devlop our project and implementing the Scrum framework to achieve our goals. 
    We will be developing in 2 week sprints in order to focus on the most important features first and to allow for flexibility in our development process.
    This will emphasize the importance of communication and collaboration between team members while allowing us to be flexible with our plan in response to events or changes that occur in the development process.
    


## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders
    See Stakeholders and Personas Folder for more

### Description of Clients/Users
    See Stakeholders and Personas Folder for more
### List of Stakeholders and their Positions (if applicable)
    (Stakeholders pulled from Milestone2.md)
    Development Team Members - The development team will be responsible for the creation of the application. They will be responsible for the design, implementation, and testing of the application. They will also be responsible for the documentation of the application.
    Tournament Organizers - The tournament organizers will be responsible for the creation of tournaments with our application. They will be able to create tournaments, add players to tournaments, and update the status of tournaments. They are a key stakeholder because they will be the ones using the applications unique features the most in a techincal/admin role. 
    Gamers - Gamers will be able to use the application to find tournaments to participate in. They will be able to view the status of tournaments and see what tournaments are upcoming. They are a key stakeholder because they will be the ones using the application the most from a registered user role.
    Spectators - Spectators will be able to use the application to view the status of tournaments and see what tournaments are upcoming, along with being able to see a place to watch the tournament. They are a key stakeholder because they will be the ones using the application the most from a casual user role.
    Sponsors - Sponsors will be able to see what tournaments can be sponsored and will be able to contact the tournament organizers to sponsor a tournament. They are a key stakeholder because they will be the ones using the application the most from a business role.
    Who are they? Why are they a stakeholder?

## Initial Requirements Elaboration and Elicitation
    See Requirements_template for more
    (from Requirements_template.md)
    1. Is the goal or outcome well defined?  Does it make sense?
    2. What is not clear from the given description?
    3. How about scope?  Is it clear what is included and what isn't?
    4. What do you not understand?
            * Technical domain knowledge
            * Business domain knowledge
    5. Is there something missing?
    6. Get answers to these questions.

### Elicitation Questions
    (questions above are the primary questions to ask, these are secondary questions that may help refine the answers to the primary questions)
    1. What are the main goals of the project?
    2. What are the main features of the project?
    3. Why are these features important?
    4. What are the main use cases of the project?
    5. What kind of users will be using the project?
    6. Why use this project over other similar projects? What makes this project unique?

### Elicitation Interviews
    1. We found that we are on the same page with what we want to create, a user friendly first tournament application that allows anybody to just use it. We also found that Wills unique perspective, having used competing applications, helped us narrow down what we need first and foremost and what is considered irritating on the user side of things. Our primary goal is to have a user friendly experience while also being able to create complex tournaments that remove certain headaches that come with creating and managing tournaments.
    2. From our description, the main thing that was not clear at first was both the scope of the project and the features that we wanted to implement to reach this goal. What makes things user friendly and easy to use? We narrowed down our scope to a few things. First, we want to be able to have our users to be able to easily sign up within a few clicks without reductive steps or questions, and have this ease of use be persistent with the rest of the application in regard to signing up for tournaments or verifying results. Second, the tournament organizer must be able to create complex tournaments, and be able to manage conflicts and issues that arise during the tournament with tools we create for them. Third, we want simple tournaments to be able to be created without having to login, with a few tournament choices so that the user doesn't have to create it from scratch. These are the primay goals we are striving for and help focus our scope on just a few things, even if some other features sound like good ideas to add.

    6.See 1: What makes this project unique is that we are trying to create a user friendly experience for both the tournament organizer and the user. We are also trying to create a complex tournament creation system that allows for a lot of customization and flexibility while maintaining that simple ease of use casual users get to experience.
